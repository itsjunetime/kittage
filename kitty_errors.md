- Spec doesn't say that you MUST specify either `i` or `I`, but it seems to not respond if you have neither
- Using an id of 0 silently fails (instead of reporting an error or displaying an anonymous image)
- We need clarification on what will be responded to with an error and what will simply be ignored
- Is the total size limit that the terminal operates on dependent upon pre-compressed data or post-compressed data (if someone is using compression)
- Does 'delete all intersecting with cursor' include those with a non-zero z-index?
- Are implementing terminals expected to be able to read any common image filetype or just png/rgb/rgba
