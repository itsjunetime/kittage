	/// Query the terminal to determine if a specific image can be transmitted & displayed. The
	/// following is quoted from the spec:
	///
	/// Since a client has no a-priori knowledge of whether it shares a filesystem/shared memory with the terminal emulator, it can send an id with the control data, using the i key (which can be an arbitrary positive integer up to 4294967295, it must not be zero). If it does so, the terminal emulator will reply after trying to load the image, saying whether loading was successful or not. For example:
	///
	/// ```text
	/// <ESC>_Gi=31,s=10,v=2,t=s;<encoded /some-shared-memory-name><ESC>\
	/// ```
	///
	/// to which the terminal emulator will reply (after trying to load the data):
	///
	/// ```text
	/// <ESC>_Gi=31;error message or OK<ESC>\
	/// ```
	///
	/// Here the i value will be the same as was sent by the client in the original request. The message data will be a ASCII encoded string containing only printable characters and spaces. The string will be OK if reading the pixel data succeeded or an error message.
	///
	/// Sometimes, using an id is not appropriate, for example, if you do not want to replace a previously sent image with the same id, or if you are sending a dummy image and do not want it stored by the terminal emulator. In that case, you can use the query action, set a=q. Then the terminal emulator will try to load the image and respond with either OK or an error, as above, but it will not replace an existing image with the same id, nor will it store the image.
	///
	/// We intend that any terminal emulator that wishes to support it can do so. To check if a terminal emulator supports the graphics protocol the best way is to send the above query action followed by a request for the [primary device attributes](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DA1.html). If you get back an answer for the device attributes without getting back an answer for the query action the terminal emulator does not support the graphics protocol.
	///
	/// This means that terminal emulators that support the graphics protocol, must reply to query actions immediately without processing other input. Most terminal emulators handle input in a FIFO manner, anyway.
	///
	/// So for example, you could send:
	///
	/// ```text
	/// <ESC>_Gi=31,s=1,v=1,a=q,t=d,f=24;AAAA<ESC>\<ESC>[c
	/// ```
	///
	/// If you get back a response to the graphics query, the terminal emulator supports the protocol, if you get back a response to the device attributes query without a response to the graphics query, it does not.

	/// This is the main point of interaction with this library - to display an image, you need to
	/// create an [`Action`] and then call this function on it.
	///
	/// This function does two main things:
	/// 1. Writes the necessary escape codes to `writer`, then flushes it.
	/// 2. Unlinks the shared memory object if necessary (see [`Medium::SharedMemObject`])
	/// 3. Reads in the terminal's response via `reader`
	/// 4. Parses the terminal's response and returns any errors that occur or are transmitted
	///
	/// Steps 1 & 2 are performed simply by calling [`Self::write_transmit_to`], so this library
	/// can be used in a sans-io method by using that instead. ([TODO]: make the parse method pub
	/// in a more ergonomic API)
	///
	/// For this function to work correctly, `writer` should be writing directly to something that
	/// flushes directly to a kitty-supporting terminal. This function assumes that, once flushed
	/// to `writer`, the terminal will respond and this response can be read by `reader`.
