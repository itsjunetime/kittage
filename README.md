# `kitty_img`

A full-featured rust library for interacting with the [kitty terminal graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/). This is still a work in progress but aims to implement all parts of the client side of the kitty terminal graphics protocol. At time of writing, it implements everything (including e.g. shared memory objects and reading in terminal responses) besides animation frames.

To start using it, you probably want to examine the documentation for the `Action` struct.
